# Automated_Kind_Response_Reddit_Bot

This program will automatically generate a comment response to a specific user whenever a new comment is left by said user. 

To begin using this program, navigate to text_files/config.json, and enter the username/password of the account you will be using to leave comments. 
Afterwards, set "target" to the username of the account you will be automatically responding to. The program is designed to be left running idefinitely and will
refresh every 15 seconds to see if the target has a new most-recent comment to reply to. 

A different version of chromedriver might be required depending on the version of Chrome you are running. The chromdriver files can be downloaded from here:
